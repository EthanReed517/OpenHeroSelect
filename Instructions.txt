OpenHeroSelect (OPH) works mostly like the original HeroSelect where you would modify a herostat.cfg file and then select the Default option.
Below is information on required files and usage:

Running OpenHeroSelect:
	- To run OPH you must must have the OpenHeroSelect.exe or OpenHeroSelect.py files, the menulocation.cfg file, a herostat.cfg file and the xmlb-compile.exe file in a same folder.
	- Make sure the required files are there, that the herostat.cfg file is set up properly and that the menulocation.cfg file matches the amout of characters you want (more information on this below).
	- Once everything is in place, OPH can be run in two different ways:
		1) By executing its .exe file (hands-off execution).
		2) By executing its .exe or .py files from a command-line interface (more customizable).
	
	1) Running OPH from its Executable:
	- To prevent issues with Windows 10 redirecting writes to the wrong location, make sure you right-click OpenHeroSelect.exe and run it as Administrator instead of just double-clicking the file.
	- OpenHeroSelect.exe will read the herostat.cfg file in its same folder, attempt to create the compiled herostat files for the game and place them in the data folder that was specified in the herostat.cfg file.
	- If everything works out well, you will be prompted by a success message and you should see your chosen heroes in-game.
	- If any issues arise you will be notified by a failure message and you might need to do some troubleshooting through the command-line methods.
	
	2) Running OPH from the Command-Line:
	- To run OPH from the command-line in Windows, open a shell such as CMD or PowerShell at the directory with the OPH files.
	- From there, execute the .exe file following by optional flags you may want to to achieve different results.
	- Alternatively, you can also execute the .py files if you have Python in your system.
	
		Flags:
			-h, --help: Display a help text with these same argument definitions.
			-d, --debug: Stop after parsing the herostat.cfg file and writing the intermediate "xml" file. It will not compile or replace gamefiles.
			-k, --keep: Keeps the menupositions indicated in the herostat.cfg file for those who prefer to manually organize their characters.
			-l, --list: Show the list of characters that were loaded from the herostat.cfg file and their to-be positions in the hero select menu.
			-v, --verbose: Write extensive process information, will show warnings, print error messages & hints on possible solutions when available.
		
		Examples:
			- ".\OpenHeroSelect.exe -h" (without the quotes) - this will run the .exe OPH file and display the help menu.
			- ".\OpenHeroSelect.exe -v -l" (without the quotes) - this will run the .exe OPH file in verbose mode, and list the character positions.
			- "python .\OpenHeroSelect.py -h" (without the quotes) - this will run the Python OPH file and display the help menu.
			- "python .\OpenHeroSelect.py -v -d" (without the quotes) - this will run the Python OPH file and stop after generating the "XML" file.
	
	
Making a herostat.cfg:
	- The herostat.cfg file is the place were you tell OPH the location of your game data directory, list the characters to be loaded and define their respective herostats.
	- An example herostat.cfg file is provided which can be used as a template.
	- Lines that start with a "#" sign are comments - they are ignored by OPH and you can use to write down notes or other remarks.
	- The first non-commented line must be a path to your MUA install's data folder. Use double backslashes instead of single ones and make sure there's a double backslash at the end of the path, for example "C:\\blah\\MUA\\data\\" (without the quotes).
	- The following sequence of non-commented lines will be treated as the list of the characters you want. The order of this characters in the selectio menu will be determined by the menulocations.cfg file (included files work from left to right).
	- After the character namelist there needs to be a line with "-----" (without quotes). This line indicates where the namelist section ends and the stat definition section begins.
	- For each name on the namelist there must be a matching stat entry. These entries consist on the character name followed by a stat definition entry (see the template for examples).
	- Herostat entries for modded characters can normally be found within their compressed packages (sometimes in the at the root, sometimes within the data folder) or in the forums.
	- Feel free to have as many names in the namelist and stats in the stat list as you want, the program will limit itself to the first 27/38/50/etc. depending on menulocations.cfg.
	
	Notes:
	- Spaces between stat entries and indentation consistency don't really matter - OPH makes use of regular expressions and other techniques to allow for some leeway.
	- If you want to rearrange the characters, you can either reorder the namelist and it'll automatically take care of it, or manually define their position and use OPH with the keep flag.
	- Defaultman is a placeholder entry - in v2.0 of OPH you can either include it in the namelist/stat entries or not - the program will automatically detect it and include it in the "XML" file anyways.
	- If any issues arise, run the program in verbose/debug mode to track the issues down, or check the forums.

Setting up menulocations.cfg:
	- The file menulocations.cfg is meant for you to manually overwrite with whichever of the other specific menulocation files you want.
	- The "menulocations - #.cfg" files contain lists lists of positions matching the number in their name.
	- Files match characters in the namelist from left to right in the selection menu rows, so the first name in the herostat.cfg will be on the left for example.
	- Pick the version with the number of characters you want and copy it with the name menulocations.cfg (the included default one is for the standard 27 characters, but you can replace it with the expanded roster hack versions if you use those).
	
	Example:
	- If you want 50 heroes, then either copy the contents of the "menulocations - 50..." file into menulocations.cfg or swap their names.
	- There is typically no need to modify the contents of the menulocations files themselves, unless you want to rearrange the positions of the characters that way.
	- You can add comments, they must be on their own line and the line must start with the '#' character.
	- A great way of visualizing what is going on is to run OPH with the list flag.
	
Troubleshooting:
	- The xmlb-compile.exe file is a third-party file written by NBA2KSTUFF which does the actual compiling from an intermediate "XML" format into the binary files for the game.
	- If you run into errors, try to run the program in the verbose mode first - it provides error propagation as well as hints on how to solve some of the most common ones.
	- If things go horribly wrong, delete everything except OpenHeroSelect.exe, xmlb-compile.exe, and the .cfg files, and try running the program again.
	- If that doesn't work, try running the app/command-line as Administrator (right-click on OpenHeroSelect, Run as administrator)
	
Converting the original HeroSelect's herostat.cfg file into the OpenHeroSelect version:
	- Data folder path is exactly the same.
	- Name list is slightly different.
		- defaultman doesn't have to be at the beginning, OpenHeroSelect takes all the names from the first one down (extra names are just ignored like the old HeroSelect, so you can leave more names in after the ones that will be included if you want).
		- endofffile should be removed, OpenHeroSelect takes care of it.
	- The old HeroSelect left a blank line between the list of names and the list of stats, replace this blank line with a line that just has 5 hyphens (-----). This is the divider OpenHeroSelect uses to understand where the names end and stats begin.
	- Stat list is slightly different.
		- endofffile stat should be removed. OpenHeroSelect takes care of it.
	- Remove the "EOF" from the end of the file. This is no longer necessary and could cause issues.
