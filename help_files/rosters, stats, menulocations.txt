Menulocations (roster layout) files should be placed in the menulocations folder, and should end with ".cfg".
You shouldn't need to modify these files unless new roster hacks become available. The included ones should cover existing roster hacks/sizes.
Menulocation files are named based on the size of the roster and version of the roster hack, if applicable.
The provided menulocations are ordered left-to-right, ignoring whether the character is in the front or back. This means you should order your roster in the order you want your characters, left to right.

Individual rosters can be placed in the rosters folder, and should end with ".cfg". (roster.cfg, bigroster.cfg, etc.)
Each name in the roster file should match a stats file in either the json or xml folder.
It's completely fine to have more characters in your roster file than in the menulocations file that you pick. OHS will only include the first n number of characters.
    For example, if your roster has 55 characters, but you're only using the default 27 size roster/menulocations file, your generated herostat will only include the first 27 characters from your roster.

Stats can be in either "xml" files (not real xml files, but the format the game uses) or json files. Each stat entry should be in its own file.
If a json file and xml file are found with the same name, OHS will use the json file.

The default distribution includes a roster file, stats, and menulocations that will work for all roster hacks, including the default 27, as long as you have the latest Official Characters Pack installed.
